# Pre-work - *TipMate*

**TipMate** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Stefan Bonilla**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Can change the tip amounts in the settings. These settings are saved in UserDefaults.
- [X] Can split the bill by enabling split in the settings and then using the stepper to divide the total bill.

## Notes

Had some bugs that related to how I was persisting the data. Used the debugger to fix these issues.
